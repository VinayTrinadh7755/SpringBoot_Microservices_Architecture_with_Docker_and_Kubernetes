# SpringBoot Microservices Architecture with Docker and Kubernetes

- Developed a monolithic job portal application and modularized it into microservices (Job, Company, Review) using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

- Implemented Eureka Server for dynamic service discovery and centralized registry, enabling seamless communication between services without hardcoded URLs.

- Designed inter-service communication using OpenFeign clients and RestTemplate, achieving a scalable, loosely-coupled architecture.

- Integrated Zipkin for distributed tracing and performance-bottleneck analysis across microservices.

- Packaged microservices using Docker, orchestrated with Docker Compose, demonstrating containerized deployment readiness for cloud platforms.

- Deployed containerized services on Kubernetes for orchestration and automated scaling.
