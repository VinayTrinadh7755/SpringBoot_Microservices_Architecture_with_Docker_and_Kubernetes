# SpringBoot_Microservices_Architecture_with_Docker_and_Kubernetes

• Developed a monolithic job portal application and modularized it into microservices (Job, Company, 
  Review) using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
• Implemented Eureka Server for dynamic service discovery and centralized registry, enabling seamless 
  communication between services without hardcoded URLs.
• Designed inter-service communication using OpenFeign clients and RestTemplate, achieving scalable, 
  loosely coupled architecture.
• Integrated Zipkin for distributed tracing and performance bottleneck analysis across microservices.
• Packaged microservices using Docker, orchestrated with Docker Compose, and demonstrated containerized deployment readiness for cloud platforms.
• Deployed containerized services using Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.
